# Tinder Bot 
A bot for Tinder created using python, Tinder API and robobrowser.

### Config File
<h5> <strong> facebook_access_token and fb_user_id </strong></h5>

Simply input your facebook username/email and password in your config file. Then, the fb_auth_token.py module will programmatically retrieve your facebook_access_token and fb_user_id. These are then used to generate your tinder_auth_token in tinder_api.py which grants you access to your data! Happy Swiping!

<strong> Note: </strong> With the help of <a href=https://github.com/philipperemy/Deep-Learning-Tinder/blob/master/tinder_token.py> philliperemy </a>, I have included a programatic way to acquire your facebook_token. Now, in your config.py just input your facebook username and password.

### Run
The app can be run by
`python bot.py`
